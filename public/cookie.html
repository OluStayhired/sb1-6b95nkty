            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information and to personalize your experience. Cookies can be "persistent" or "session" cookies:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
                <li><strong>Session Cookies</strong> are temporary cookies that remain on your device until you close your web browser.</li>
                <li><strong>Persistent Cookies</strong> remain on your device for a set period or until you delete them manually.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">How We Use Cookies</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                We use cookies for several purposes, primarily to ensure the Service functions correctly, to understand how you interact with our Service, and to improve your user experience. Specifically, we use cookies to:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
                <li><strong>Operate and Maintain the Service:</strong> Essential cookies are necessary for the Service to function properly. This includes enabling you to log in, navigate between pages, and use core features.</li>
                <li><strong>Improve Your Experience:</strong> We use cookies to remember your preferences (like timezone settings), simplify your login process, and personalize content.</li>
                <li><strong>Analyze Usage (Analytics):</strong> We use cookies to collect information about how users interact with our Service, such as the pages visited, the time spent on pages, and any errors encountered. This helps us understand what parts of our Service are most popular and where we can make improvements.</li>
                <li><strong>Security:</strong> Cookies help us identify and prevent security risks, like unauthorized access to your account.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Types of Cookies We Use</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Based on the purposes described above, SoSavvy uses the following categories of cookies:
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">1. Strictly Necessary Cookies</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                These cookies are essential for you to browse the Service and use its features, such as accessing secure areas. Without these cookies, services like logging in or remembering your account details cannot be provided.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Example: Cookies that remember your login status or session ID.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">2. Performance/Analytics Cookies</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                These cookies collect information about how you use the Service (e.g., which pages you visit most often, if you encounter error messages). These cookies do not collect information that directly identifies you. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. They are only used to improve how the Service works.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Example: Google Analytics cookies (if used) to track website performance and user behavior.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">3. Functionality Cookies</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                These cookies allow the Service to remember choices you make (such as your username, language, or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for, such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect may be anonymized, and they cannot track your Browse activity on other websites.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Example: Cookies that remember your preferred timezone or display settings.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Third-Party Cookies</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                In addition to our own cookies, we may also use various third-parties' cookies to report usage statistics of the Service, deliver advertisements on and through the Service, and so on. For example, we might use:
